    <h2>Trenton Jones</h2>
    <p>Hey Everyone, my name is Tenton and I have never really had a nickname. I am currently a Biochemistry major and are taking this class as a fun elective course.I do plan on going thorugh with my biochemistry degree and eventually moving on to medical school.I hopefully want to become a pediatrician when everything is all said and done.</p>
    <p>I am currently 22 years old and was born and raised in Southern California. Specifically in Orange County in a town called Garden Grove. I am currently single and try to actively date even though it is hard when classes take up most of my time right now.</p>
    <p>When I do have some free time I currently play video games or if I can get enough people to join I also enjoy board games and card games. My favorite board game currently is Betrayal at House on the Hill however can never find enough people will to play that one though. I also recently just aquired an Nintendo Switch and play that with my roommates and family when I am home.I currently play a lot of Elden Ring and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to this class a lot even though it does not have much to do with my major or future plans. I do like to cnsider this a small hobby I have as I find it fascinating but confusing and could not see myself doing this as a career.</p>
